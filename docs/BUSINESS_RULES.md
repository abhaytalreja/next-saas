# Multi-Tenant Architecture Business Rules

## Overview

This document outlines the business rules and constraints for the multi-tenant architecture implementation in the NextSaaS platform. These rules ensure data isolation, security, and proper resource management across tenant boundaries.

## 1. Organization Management

### 1.1 Organization Structure
- **Single Owner Rule**: Every organization must have exactly one owner at all times
- **Owner Transfer**: Ownership can be transferred, but the previous owner must explicitly approve the transfer
- **Organization Deletion**: Only owners can delete organizations, and all dependent resources must be cleaned up first
- **Slug Uniqueness**: Organization slugs must be globally unique and URL-safe
- **Status Management**: Organizations can have statuses: `active`, `suspended`, `deleted`

### 1.2 Organization Settings
- **Member Limits**: Organizations have configurable member limits based on their plan
- **Workspace Limits**: Maximum number of workspaces per organization is plan-dependent
- **Feature Flags**: Organizations have feature toggles that control available functionality
- **Billing Integration**: Organization settings must sync with billing system for plan enforcement

### 1.3 Organization Lifecycle
- **Trial Period**: New organizations start with a 14-day trial with full features
- **Suspension**: Suspended organizations retain data but disable access
- **Deletion**: Deleted organizations enter a 30-day retention period before permanent deletion
- **Data Export**: Organizations can export their data at any time before deletion

## 2. Membership and Role Management

### 2.1 Membership Rules
- **Unique Membership**: Users can only be members of an organization once
- **Invitation Expiry**: Invitations expire after 7 days unless configured otherwise
- **Self-Removal**: Members can remove themselves unless they are the sole owner
- **Owner Protection**: The last owner cannot be removed or have their role changed
- **Status Tracking**: Members have statuses: `active`, `invited`, `suspended`

### 2.2 Role Hierarchy
- **System Roles**: `owner > admin > member` (immutable hierarchy)
- **Custom Roles**: Organizations can create custom roles with specific permissions
- **Permission Inheritance**: Higher-level roles inherit permissions from lower-level roles
- **Role Assignment**: Only users with `organization:manage` permission can assign roles
- **Role Deletion**: Custom roles cannot be deleted if they have active assignments

### 2.3 Permission System
- **Resource-Based**: Permissions are scoped to specific resources (organization, workspace, project)
- **Action-Based**: Each permission defines a specific action (view, create, update, delete, manage)
- **Wildcard Support**: `*` permission grants all access (reserved for owners)
- **Permission Validation**: All API endpoints must validate permissions before executing
- **Audit Trail**: All permission changes must be logged for compliance

## 3. Workspace Management

### 3.1 Workspace Structure
- **Organization Scope**: Workspaces belong to exactly one organization
- **Default Workspace**: Organizations must have at least one workspace (default)
- **Workspace Limits**: Number of workspaces limited by organization settings
- **Slug Uniqueness**: Workspace slugs must be unique within the organization
- **Member Inheritance**: Workspace members inherit organization membership

### 3.2 Workspace Settings
- **Visibility**: Workspaces can be `public` (all org members) or `private` (invited only)
- **Default Assignment**: New organization members can be auto-assigned to default workspace
- **Archive/Delete**: Archived workspaces retain data but are read-only
- **Template Support**: Workspaces can be created from templates

### 3.3 Workspace Access Control
- **Permission Inheritance**: Workspace permissions respect organization-level permissions
- **Local Overrides**: Workspace-specific permissions can be more restrictive
- **Member Management**: Workspace admins can manage workspace-level membership
- **Resource Limits**: Workspaces have limits on projects, storage, and API usage

## 4. Data Isolation and Security

### 4.1 Row-Level Security (RLS)
- **Organization Context**: All queries must include organization context
- **User Context**: All queries must validate user membership
- **Permission Context**: All queries must validate user permissions
- **Automatic Filtering**: RLS policies automatically filter data by organization
- **Policy Enforcement**: RLS policies cannot be bypassed by application code

### 4.2 API Security
- **Rate Limiting**: Different rate limits per organization tier
- **Authentication**: All API requests must include valid authentication
- **Authorization**: All endpoints must validate permissions before processing
- **Audit Logging**: All API actions must be logged with user and organization context
- **Input Validation**: All input must be validated and sanitized

### 4.3 Data Protection
- **Encryption at Rest**: All sensitive data must be encrypted in the database
- **Encryption in Transit**: All API communication must use HTTPS/TLS
- **Data Retention**: Data retention policies must respect legal requirements
- **Right to Deletion**: Users can request deletion of their personal data
- **Data Portability**: Organizations can export their data in standard formats

## 5. Resource Management

### 5.1 Usage Quotas
- **API Calls**: Organizations have monthly API call limits based on plan
- **Storage**: File and document storage limits per organization
- **Members**: Maximum number of organization members per plan
- **Workspaces**: Maximum number of workspaces per organization
- **Projects**: Maximum number of projects per workspace

### 5.2 Billing Integration
- **Usage Tracking**: All billable usage must be accurately tracked
- **Plan Enforcement**: Features must respect plan limitations
- **Overage Handling**: Define behavior when limits are exceeded
- **Plan Changes**: Handle upgrades/downgrades gracefully
- **Payment Failures**: Suspend access on payment failures with grace period

### 5.3 Performance Management
- **Query Optimization**: All queries must include appropriate indexes
- **Caching Strategy**: Implement caching for frequently accessed data
- **Background Jobs**: Use queues for long-running operations
- **Database Scaling**: Implement read replicas for query performance
- **CDN Integration**: Use CDN for static asset delivery

## 6. Compliance and Auditing

### 6.1 Audit Requirements
- **Action Logging**: All user actions must be logged with full context
- **Permission Changes**: All role and permission changes must be audited
- **Data Access**: All data access must be logged for compliance
- **System Events**: All system-level events must be tracked
