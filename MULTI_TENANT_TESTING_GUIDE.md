# üè¢ Multi-Tenant Testing Guide

## Overview

The multi-tenant mode (`NEXT_PUBLIC_ORGANIZATION_MODE=multi`) enables users to create and join multiple organizations, similar to how Slack, Notion, or Linear work.

## Setup

1. **Ensure environment is set to multi mode**:
   ```env
   NEXT_PUBLIC_ORGANIZATION_MODE=multi
   ```
   ‚úÖ Already set in your `.env.local`

2. **Database is already configured**:
   - The same database schema supports all modes
   - No additional SQL needed!

## Testing the Multi-Tenant Flow

### 1. Sign Up and Organization Creation

1. Start the app: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to `http://localhost:3010/auth/sign-up`
3. Create a new account
4. **In multi mode**: You'll be prompted to create your first organization
   - Enter organization name
   - The system will create a unique slug
   - You'll be the owner of this organization

### 2. Organization Switching

1. After signing in, check the header for the **Organization Switcher**
2. Click on it to see:
   - Current organization
   - List of all your organizations
   - "Create New Organization" option

### 3. Creating Additional Organizations

1. Click "Create New Organization" in the switcher
2. Fill in:
   - Organization name
   - Optional: description, website
3. You can now switch between multiple organizations

### 4. Inviting Team Members

1. Go to `/settings/organization/members`
2. Click "Invite Members"
3. Enter email addresses and assign roles:
   - **Admin**: Can manage organization settings and members
   - **Member**: Regular access to organization resources
4. Send invitations

### 5. Accepting Invitations

To test the invitation flow:

1. **Option A - Same Browser (Quick Test)**:
   - Sign out
   - Check the invitation email or use the invitation link
   - Sign up/sign in with the invited email
   - Accept the invitation

2. **Option B - Different Browser/Incognito**:
   - Open invitation link in incognito/different browser
   - Sign up with invited email
   - You'll automatically join the organization

### 6. Managing Multiple Organizations

As a user with multiple organizations:

1. **Context Switching**:
   - Use the Organization Switcher to change context
   - All data is scoped to the selected organization

2. **Different Roles**:
   - You might be an owner in one org, member in another
   - UI adapts based on your role

3. **Organization Settings**:
   - Each org has independent settings
   - Billing is per-organization
   - Custom domains (if enabled)
