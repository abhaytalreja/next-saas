# Testing Strategy and Requirements

## Documentation Updates

- Created comprehensive testing documentation:
  - `./FEATURE_TESTING_REQUIREMENTS.md`
  - `./FEATURE_TESTING_CHECKLIST.md`
  - Updated main `README.md` with testing guidelines

## Testing Approach

### Unit Testing (Mandatory)
- 80% minimum coverage across all metrics
- Comprehensive testing of:
  - Component variants
  - Component states
  - Component interactions
  - Error handling
  - Edge cases
- Implemented accessibility testing

### Integration Testing (Mandatory)
- Validate API integration points
- Test multi-tenant scenarios
- Verify authentication flows
- Confirm component composition

### End-to-End Testing (Mandatory)
- Complete user journey testing
- Cross-browser compatibility
- Visual regression tests
- Performance benchmarks

## Quality Gates and Enforcement

### Blocking Conditions
- Missing unit tests
- Coverage below 80%
- No integration tests for API calls
- No E2E tests for user flows
- Accessibility violations
- Visual regressions
- Breaking existing tests

### Enforcement Mechanisms
- CI/CD Pipeline blocks incomplete tests
- Mandatory code review process
- Staging test requirements before production

## Current Testing Infrastructure
- Jest + React Testing Library
- Playwright for E2E and visual testing
- jest-axe for accessibility
- 92.5% UI component test coverage
- Cross-browser testing configured
- Visual regression testing implemented

## Feature Testing Requirements
- Comprehensive unit tests
- Integration tests for workflows
- End-to-end user journey tests
- Accessibility verification
- Performance assessment
- Cross-browser compatibility
